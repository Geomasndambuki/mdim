      <section class="liv">
      <h2>THE BIRTH OF MDIMA</h2>
      <p> Mdima ( Makueni Diaspora Mombasa Chapter) came into being in March 2018. This was an initiative of the Makueni County Government (MCG) with Mr.Richard Kinovi as the contact person.<br>
The MCG appointed Richard to mobilize the Makueni residents living in Mombasa to participate in the county government’s County Integrated Development Programme (CIDP) of 2018. After our initial meeting held at Stadium Holiday Inn Mombasa, the idea of forming ourselves into an investment group was unanimously agreed by all present. A meeting date was suggested to be on 1/3/2018 after the CIDP meeting held at Jambo Hotel in Changamwe Mombasa and addressed by the then Governor Professor Kivutha Kibwana, Deputy Governor Ms Adelina Mwau and ECMs.<br>
The Governor and his team urged the meeting to consider forming ourselves into investment groups and investing in the ENE Micro-Finance Bank which was being fronted by his Government and which was supposedly geared to economically elevate the Makueni residents.</p>
  <p>The meeting held on 1/3/2018 unanimously resolved that we contribute money for investment starting with the ENE Micro-Finance Bank but land being the most viable option. By the end of year 2018 we had contributed a total Kes 5.6m.<br>
ENE Micro-Finance Bank never was and quite a number of the members were not pleased with the fact that the money was in the bank for over year. In May 2019 at Special General Meeting (SGM) held at Holiday Inn Mombasa it was resolved we form a cooperative and that is how Mdima Investment Cooperative Society Ltd was born.</p>    
          <P>In 2020 there was the worldwide corona 19 pandemic that originated from China and swept across the whole globe affecting economies. We were no exception and quite a number of members by end of 2020 demanded refund of their funds initially intended for ENE Micro-Finance Bank which had been refunded back to Mdima but yet to be invested. A whooping kes2.3m was refunded in early 2021. In the year 2021 Mdima acquired its first land parcel of 2 acres just opposite the gate of the Konza Techno City at a cost of Kes 3.7m. The land was demarcated into 16 plots with intention to sell 14 plots to Mdima members and retain 2 plots for future development for group members.</P>
      <p>Year 2022 was the first year for Mdima to earn surplus as we managed to sell 6 plots out of the intended 14 plots. We reported a surplus of Kes 1.7m. Same year 2022, Mdima acquired another 2 acre parcel of land about 1km from Mombasa along Katumani – Machakos road. Mdima is on the move now!!!<br>
Come 2023 and the BODs decided to hold the AGM at Malili town so that members can have the opportunity to view the assets. After the members visit, at the AGM members moved and resolved no more sells of the Konza land. They considered it a gem and was unanimous that this should be held for the benefit of Mdima members.<BR>
Mdima is geared to propel to higher gains in the coming few years and believes that their presence in the Techno city shall be one to reckon on.
Mdima is now open to any Makueni born resident to join at a goodwill of Kes 100,000 up to the next AGM.<BR>
Join Mdima today and own a piece of the Konza Techno City.</p>
